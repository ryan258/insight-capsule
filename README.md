## 🧍 Accessibility & Purpose

You shouldn’t have to fight for every inch just to build something creative.
You shouldn’t have to debug tools that were meant to support you.

If you do pick this back up — now or later — I’ll be ready to support it right.

Wishing you *all the clarity and control you deserve*.
