# 🗺️ Project Roadmap — Insight Capsule Generator

A clear, step-by-step plan to transform this into a fully functioning AI swarm OS for generating scrollable, insight-dense, truth-aligned knowledge artifacts.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Solid Foundation (Complete)

- [x] Set up Python project with Cursor on Windows
- [x] Scaffold full directory structure via PowerShell script
- [x] Build and test GPT interface with model routing
- [x] Auto-log GPT runs to markdown capsules
- [x] Auto-generate index.md for easy browsing

---

## 🚧 Phase 2: Voice Input + Capsule Builder (In Progress)

- [ ] 🎙 Integrate Whisper (or OpenAI transcription) for voice → idea
- [ ] 🧠 `clarifier_agent.py` — extract structure + brief from voice or raw idea
- [ ] 🖼 `capsule_renderer.py` — convert capsule to responsive HTML format
- [ ] 📖 Add markdown → PDF or HTML converter for output viewing on tablet
- [ ] 🔁 Log both raw idea and structured capsule in each `.md` file

## 🧠 Phase 3: Agent Swarm Expansion

- [ ] 🧩 `extractor_agent.py` — break brief into sub-insights + visual metaphors
- [ ] ✍️ `capsule_writer.py` — write elegant, 300–500 word insight
- [ ] 🎨 `visual_mapper.py` — generate or fetch image based on insight (via DALL·E or similar)
- [ ] ✅ `truth_guard.py` — validate content accuracy, filter bias/conspiracy

---

## 📈 Phase 4: User Interface Layer (Optional)

- [ ] 🖥️ Local web UI (Flask or FastAPI + HTMX)
- [ ] 🧾 Display capsule logs, filter by role/tags
- [ ] 🎛 Upload voice or text idea → start capsule generation pipeline

---

## 🔮 Phase 5: Advanced Capabilities

- [ ] 🧠 Multi-agent dialog simulation (e.g. you vs. historical thinkers or perspectives)
- [ ] 🗺 Concept map generator from capsule archive
- [ ] 🧬 Idea genealogy (track origin and evolution of recurring concepts)
- [ ] ✨ Capsule remix engine — mix previous logs into new formats/angles

---

## 🌱 Guiding Principles

- **Low friction**: voice in, insight out
- **High signal**: truth, structure, compression over verbosity
- **Creative sovereignty**: designed for longevity, clarity, and meaning

---

## 🧭 Next Steps (as of now)

- [ ] Add Whisper-based transcription to `clarifier_agent.py`
- [ ] Build first full idea → insight capsule pipeline from real voice prompt
- [ ] Begin rendering capsules into HTML
